    <h1>Xbox Live API</h1>
    <p>Time to revisit this project with a better understanding.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>I'd like to create an app where people can interact with the Xbox Live API. There are some really neat things that you can do with it, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View details about your account</li>
      <li>View your recorded screenshots and game clips</li>
      <li>Send messages with Xbox Live</li>
      <li>Check out game stats and compare against friends</li>
      <li>and much more!</li>
    </ul>
